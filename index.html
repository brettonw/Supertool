    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.supertool.com/logo.jpg" /></div>

    <div class="par">If you have questions about what the Stanley numbers are, you can look the planes up on <a href="http://www.supertool.com/StanleyBG/stan0.htm">Blood&Gore (www.supertool.com/StanleyBG)</a>.</div>

    <div class="par">Sometimes, emails to/from me are vectored to some cyber black hole, never reaching their destination. I answer all emails, so if you haven't heard from me, your/my email is likely having high tea in said black hole, never to be heard from, so please try again.</div>

    <div class="par">If there is anything in particular that you're after, do ping me as there is a lot of stuff here that isn't on the list; the list just represents a snapshot of the previous month's haul with none of the stuff having appeared on a previous list. I like to keep things fresh here.</div>

    <div class="par">Please email me prior to sending money so that you can be sure the item is still up for grabs. Also, prices do not include shipping, which is the amount that it takes to go from me to you via the US Post Office.</div>

    <div class="par">This list goes out to many people, normally on the first Monday of the month (unless otherwise noted above). So, if you see something you want, it's the quickest finger on the trigger that wins the duel.</div>

    <div class="par">Some folks become upset that they miss out on a tool. I wish I had lots of this stuff many times over so I can satisfy the demand, but that is normally not the case. Some of it does have duplicates here, and if so, I will state that in my reply to you.</div>

    <div class="par">Also, due to the nature of selling over the wires, tools are sold on a first come, first serve basis. The first person to say "I'll take it", gets it. I have to operate this way as some will take a few days to get back to me with their interest in a particular item, and it's unfair to keep others waiting who are willing to buy the item immediately.</div>

    <div class="par">I reserve the right to correct typographical errors after the list goes out. I rarely make them, but when I do they can be major ones.</div>

    <div class="par">If you're the kind of person who puts a straightedge to the sole of a #40, to check it for flatness, or who tosses a plane on a scale to weigh it against what it states in the Stanley catalogs, you'll need to take your business elsewhere. I'll wish you luck finding perfection in something that was never made, nor intended to be, perfect. You guys know who you are, and it's best for both of us that our paths not cross.</div>

    <div class="par">Lastly, and I don't like to mention this, but if you tell me that money is on the way for something you want, and you never make good on it, we won't be doing business in the future. It's unfair, actually downright discourteous, to others who want the same thing, and I tell them it's sold. Pull this on me, and you're exorcised from the list. Sorry, but I don't tolerate this behavior well at all.</div>

    <div class="par">Don't forget the cool new tools that I'm making - a jazzy layout knife being used by professionals (made the cover of Feb.1998 FWW!), a detachable block plane handle designed to fit your standard pitch block planes, a killer Robinson's Improved Patent sliding bevel, a tilting jaw for your Emmert's vise, and the finest bench plane in production today, the Bed Rock #601. You can see it all at <a href="http://www.supertool.com/newtools.htm">www.supertool.com/newtools.htm</a>.</div>

    <div class="par">Remember, you don't have to be a connoisseur (did I spell that correctly) to shop here. You can be a wirehead, a metalhead, a zipper-head, a propellerhead, a deadhead, a cokehead, or even a knuckle dragging oaf, just like me, to shop here, as long as your dinero is green.</div>

    <div class="par">Thanks for shopping, and remember that no letters or words were injured when writing this list...</div>
